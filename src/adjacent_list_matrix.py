Below is a representation of the graph above in Python:
Notice that this adjacency list doesn't use any lists. 
The vertices collection is a dictionary which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time. 
Because a set contains the edges, we can check for edges in O(1) constant time.

Here is the representation of the graph above in an adjacency matrix:
We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional arrayâ€“a list of lists. 
With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights. 
0 denotes no relationship, but any other value represents an edge label or edge weight. 
The drawback is that we do not have a built-in association between the vertex values and their index.

In practice, implementing both the adjacency list and adjacency matrix would contain more information by including Vertex and Edge classes
